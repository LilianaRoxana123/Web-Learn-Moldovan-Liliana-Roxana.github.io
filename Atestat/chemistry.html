  <h2>Introduction to chemistry</h2>
  <p>Chemistry is the science that studies the properties, composition and transformations of matter. This field of science is broad and complex and deals with the study of all the physical and chemical things that make up the Universe.</p>
  
  <p>Chemistry is divided into several subcategories such as organic, inorganic, physical and analytical chemistry. Organic chemistry focuses on the study of organic compounds, that is, compounds that contain carbon. These compounds are essential for life on Earth and are present in molecules such as proteins, lipids and carbohydrates. Inorganic chemistry focuses on the study of inorganic compounds, meaning compounds that do not contain carbon. These compounds are present in a wide range of materials, from metals to salts and minerals.</p>

  <p>Physical chemistry deals with the study of the physical properties of matter, such as density, melting and boiling points, and electrical and thermal conductivity. This branch of chemistry is closely related to classical and quantum physics. Analytical chemistry is used to identify and quantify chemical compounds, usually by using instrumental analysis techniques such as spectroscopy and chromatography.</p>
  <p>Another important aspect of chemistry is the study of chemical reactions, whereby molecules interact and change into others. These reactions can be exothermic or endothermic and can be accelerated by the addition of catalysts or changes in environmental conditions. Chemistry is essential in industry and in the production of medicines, food, petrochemicals and many other products.</p>
  <p>Chemistry is closely related to other fields of science such as biology and physics. For example, biochemistry is a branch of chemistry that focuses on the study of molecules and chemical processes that occur in living organisms, while quantum chemistry uses quantum physics to understand the properties of atoms and molecules.</p>
