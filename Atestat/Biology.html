  <h2>Introduction to biology</h2>
  <p>Biology is a branch of science that studies life and living organisms. It deals with the study of the structure, function, development and evolution of living organisms, as well as their interactions with the environment. Biology is a vast science, covering a wide range of topics, from the molecular structure of cells to global ecology.</p>
  
  <p>A cell is the basic unit of life and is studied in detail in biology. There are two main types of cells - prokaryotic cells and eukaryotic cells. Prokaryotic cells are the simplest forms of life, which include bacteria. They do not have a distinct nucleus and the cell organelles are arranged in a disorganized manner. Eukaryotic cells are more complex and include animals, plants and fungi. They have a distinct nucleus and cell organelles are arranged in an organized manner.</p>

  <p>Another important topic in biology is evolution. Evolution explains how living organisms have developed and evolved over time. This is based on the concept of natural selection, whereby organisms with better characteristics for their environment survive and reproduce more efficiently than those with weaker characteristics.</p>

  <p>Biology also includes the study of the physiological systems of living organisms, such as the nervous system, the cardiovascular system, and the respiratory system. These systems allow organisms to respond and adapt to environmental changes.</p>

  <p>Biology is also closely related to other fields of science such as chemistry and physics. Biochemistry studies the molecules in living organisms and their interactions, while physics can be used to understand processes such as diffusion and osmosis that occur in cells.</p>
